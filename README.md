# DCGANs
This project focuses on implementing **Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGANs)** using **TensorFlow** to generate high-quality synthetic images. The model consists of a **generator** that creates images from random noise and a **discriminator** that distinguishes real images from generated ones, both improving through adversarial training. The dataset used for training can be **MNIST, CIFAR-10, CelebA, or a custom dataset**, allowing the model to learn meaningful patterns and features. By leveraging convolutional layers and batch normalization, DCGANs can produce visually coherent and realistic images, making this project valuable for **image synthesis, data augmentation, and creative AI applications** in fields like gaming, fashion, and digital art.
